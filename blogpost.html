                Free climing is one of the most dangerous sports and that is exactly why adrenaline junkies seek it. As opposed to regular climbing, free climbing does not have a rope to support you. This adds incredibly to the danger. This is not recommended even for proffessionals yet many people still do this yearly.

                Skydiving is exactly what it sounds like, you jump out of a plane or off of a tall cliff or building and glide down to the ground. Even though you have a parachute it is still very dangerous and definetly a great way to get your addrenaline up.

                Bungee jumping is when you are attached to a stretchy cord and pushed off of a tall cliff or bridge. When the cord fully extends you are then rubberbanded directly up at sufficiently high speeds. This is safer than the other ones because of it's numerous safety features but would still give you an intense adrenaline rush.
